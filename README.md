# osTicket-Automate-Exporting-Ticket-Reports
This is a simple script that logs into osTicket and downloads(exports) the ticket data reports.

This is built using python 3.8.5 and selenium, so you must have them downloaded. This script is made to work with the Chrome Webdriver. The current version of the ticket system that I am running this on is osTicket (v1.14.1).

In order for this to work for you, you must change the osTicket username and password to your own, and change the two URLs to correlate with your helpdesk. Also, you must change the driver location to your own specified location. I have also noted these changes in the code.
